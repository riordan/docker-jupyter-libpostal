# Docker-Libpostal
An example installation of [Libpostal](https://github.com/openvenues/libpostal) in a Docker container.

Don't use this docker image because it can't really be used. There's no microservice to be taken advantage of at this time. Sorry.

But if you need Libpostal + bindings for a particular application, this is a path you can follow (but it's probably best to just follow the [latest instructions on the Libpostal Readme](https://github.com/openvenues/libpostal).)
